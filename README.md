if you want to scrape an area then search for that area in TripAdvisor's homepage, click on the restaurants tab of this area and copy the link. Pass -i or -info  for the restaurant info like before, pass the -m and then pass the previous copied link. e.x. Python scraper.py -m -i --url"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g189484-Corinth_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html" .
